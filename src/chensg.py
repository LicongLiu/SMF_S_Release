    A simplified version of the Chen SG filter for vegetation index timeseries smooth.
    Please refer to the article for details:
        A simple method for reconstructing a high-quality NDVI time-series data set based on the Savitzky-Golay filter.
    Note:
        This algorithm is just an simplified python implementation of that article, just to demonstrate how to use the
        SMFS algorithm. The complete Chen SG filtering algorithm can be downloaded from this website:
